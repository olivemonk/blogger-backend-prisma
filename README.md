# Blogging Backend with Prisma & MongoDB

This backend application serves as the foundation for a blogging platform. It incorporates modern technologies and best practices to provide user authentication, post management, and data storage. Here's an overview of the key features and the technology stack used:

## Features Implemented

### User Authentication

- **Signup:** Users can create accounts by providing a unique email, username, and password.
- **Login:** Registered users can log in using their email and password.
- **Logout:** Authenticated users can log out, which invalidates their session.
- **JWT Tokens & cookie-parser:** Authentication is managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), stored as browser cookies using .

### Post Management

- **Create Post:** Authenticated users can create new blog posts by providing a title and content.
- **Read Posts:** Users and visitors can view a list of all blog posts.
- **Get All Posts:** Users can retrieve a specific blog post by its ID.
- **Update Post:** Authors can update the title and content of their own posts.
- **Delete Post:** Authors can delete their own posts.

### Data Storage and Management

- **Prisma ORM:** Prisma is used to interact with the database, providing an Object-Relational Mapping layer for data manipulation.
- **MongoDB:** MongoDB serves as the database to store user information, posts, and related data.

### Security and Validation

- **bcrypt:** Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- **JWT Tokens:** JSON Web Tokens are used for user authentication and session management.
- **express-validator:** User input is validated using the express-validator library to prevent invalid or malicious data.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js:** The application is built on the Node.js runtime.
- **Express.js:** Express is used to create the web server and handle HTTP requests and routes.
- **Prisma:** Prisma is utilized as the ORM to interact with the database.
- **MongoDB:** MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database for data storage.
- **bcrypt:** The bcrypt library is used for secure password hashing.
- **jsonwebtoken:** JSON Web Tokens are employed for user authentication and token generation.
- **express-validator:** Input validation is handled using the express-validator library.
- **cookie-parser:** The cookie-parser library is used to manage browser cookies.

## Key Takeaways

- This backend provides a solid foundation for building a blogging platform with user authentication and post management capabilities.
- The technology stack leverages modern tools to ensure secure data storage, authentication, and validation.
- Developers can extend this backend by adding more features, refining security measures, and optimizing performance.
